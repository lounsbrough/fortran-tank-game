# fortran-tank-game
This is a completely text-based version of the classic tank game. This was a college assignment during my freshman year.

To run this, you will need a fortran compiler: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran.

You can run the game with these commands:
```sh
gfortran -c Tank.f90
gfortran -o Tank Tank.o
./Tank
```
